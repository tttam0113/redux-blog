Redux Blog
===========================================

After finishing a course about React, Redux on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and do some examples for advance redux pattern [Thinking in Redux](https://leanpub.com/thinking-in-Redux), I want to build a blog page from scratch to practice. 

I apply redux pattern in this project, using firebase to store data and authentication.

I build all middlewares by myself and do not use third-party for middlewares.

Here is demo: https://tttam0113-redux-blog.herokuapp.com/
